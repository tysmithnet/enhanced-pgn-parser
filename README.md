# enhanced-pgn-parser
This is lexer/parser for enhanced PGN databases. The enhanced PGN form makes heavy use of block comments and commands to provide supplemental information. For example, collored squares and arrows are encoded in block comments, and existing parsers simply discard block comments.

## Installation
